## xcodebuild test hangs when piping it's output

http://openradar.appspot.com/27447948

Summary:
The command `xcodebuild test | tee xcodebuild.log` (or piping to any other command) hangs forever.
This is especially bad since CI systems like Jenkins need JUnit output in XML format. This is done by piping xcodebuildâ€™s output into commands like xcpretty. So in other words: `xcodebuild test` is currently completely unusable for CI.

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the attached XcodebuildHangs.zip and call `./test.sh`.
XcodebuildHangs.zip contains a new Xcode project with 1 unit and 1 UI test.
test.sh calls `xcodebuild test | tee xcodebuild.log`.

Expected Results:
xcodebuild runs all tests, outputs all results and exits. xcodebuild.log contains the output.

Actual Results:
xcodebuild runs all tests, outputs all results, but never exits.

Version:
Xcode beta 3 (8S174q)

Notes:
`xcodebuild test` hangs since Xcode 8 beta 1. Everything works correctly in Xcode 7.3.1.

Configuration:
OS X 10.11.6
Xcode beta 3 (8S174q)

Tested on iOS 10 GM, not fixed.
