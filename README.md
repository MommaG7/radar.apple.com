# Sample Projects for Apple Radars

This repository contains most of our current radars. We can't share all samples because some might contain sensitive data or [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/) source code, but we try to share as much as we can.
The radar is also mirrored on [OpenRadar](openradar.appspot.com) and we keep a `README.md` file in each folder to backup the text.

Why so many radars? We have many customers and they often run into weird edge cases and we help them to solve their issue. Sometimes it's our bug, sometimes Apple is to blame - but our customers pay good money for our product so they want a solution, not an excuse. So most radars also include a workaround - sometimes horrible, sometimes decent, sometimes desperate. Pull requests appreciated if you find a better one, or if radars written in Swift no longer compile... (We intentionally write them all in ObjC to not have this code-rot)
